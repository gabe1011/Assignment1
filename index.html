					<h1>Personal Information:</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Hey, I’m Gabe Jones. While my parents are from Italy and England, I was born in Brisbane and moved to Tasmania in 2015. After finishing high school at Launceston College in 2019, I worked and studied part time up until 2022. </p>

					<p>While I wish my work was relevant to my interests and hobbies, my previous employments were at a Coffee Shop and Bakery. Throughout high school I mainly focused on math’s related subjects and undertook an electrotechnology course that centered its learning around electrical work. After achieving a certificate II in said course, I am now studying a Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT – hopefully majoring in software development and will be moving to Melbourne shortly. </p>

					<p>Starting with Nintendo systems throughout my youth, I have been playing video games for almost my whole life. This left me dedicated to the company and a few of their more popular series like Zelda and Pokémon. Getting my first computer at eleven I played Minecraft and Skyrim until finding DOTA2, which was the only game I played for about four years. I then spent the following years playing Classic World of Warcraft. I also enjoy souls like, rogue like and indie games. Not a big movie or TV fan, usually I just watch twitch as my secondary media.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT:</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>As previously stated, my interest in I.T started from a young age. Growing up in a time where most people my age were constantly exposed to different forms of evolving tech, I was always fascinated as a child. I think that growing up with some of the biggest advances in technology is also one of the major influences towards my interest in I.T. I am particularly interested in fields such as computer graphics, hardware, and gaming. </p>

					<p>Regarding the career side of my interest in the field, I’m a simple person and I believe even working a tech support job at a school or something would be a fulfilling line of work. On the other hand, I am excited to work in a more complicated and demanding role, where I could be continuously learning different aspects to keep up with evolving technology. I think it’s important to be able to get real gratification for the work that you do, visualising and creating something that solves a problem has always been at the top of my list.</p>

					<p>I have never had any major role models throughout life early on who heavily influenced my interest. Later once I was already invested, I found names that I looked up to in the industry. I feel that I take more inspiration and motivation from smaller game developers and such, rather than modern tech giants.</p>

					<p>My experience in everyday computing knowledge is well above average, but again the average person has not spent majority of their time on a computer. Simply from starting this course I have already learnt a lot. I knew of many terms surrounding networking, programming, and databases but my knowledge of actualities was at a base level. </p>

					<p>The major factor in deciding where I wanted to study was the location being Melbourne. Reason being that Tasmania has very little prospects for young adults, in both its career and recreational areas. I always enjoyed living in Brisbane and visiting the city as a child. I am hoping that moving to Melbourne and starting my new life will revitalise my appreciation for such things. RMIT has always been a heavily recommended university by my peers who share similar interests, and the university also hosts a few of my long-term friends already. </p>

					<p>While I have spent most of my youth on a computer, I feel as if my practical understanding and experience is small. My current ideal career lies somewhere within the tech industry, but I am not yet sure where exactly, my main goal throughout my studies would be to find which area interests me the most and would fit as a future profession. I am expecting to use my current abilities to help grasp any newfound learnings. A few areas that I am looking forward to include programming, cyber security, and IT management. </p>

					<h2>Premier IT Technician</h2>
					<h3>Description:</h3>
					<p>Running on a global scale, the company has multiple teams around the world. The successful applicant’s main role in this position involves them in the Australian and larger Asia and Oceanic group, where they will report to a head IT administrator in Europe. Some more general responsibilities for the role would be more familiar to any IT technician. The applicant would be diagnosing and resolving tech issues that are in their personal realm of possibility and if not referring other issues to their designated teams. They would also be producing, installing, and configuring computer hardware and software relevant to the company as well as providing support to the users. Another key responsibility would be to verify, update and maintain the equipment inventory. </p>
					<h3>Why it is Ideal:</h3>
					<p>At first glance, working on a global scale and the discussion of flexible and remote working arrangements are the two main characteristics of the position that appeal to me the most. While it is not listed in the application, there could be potential for traveling throughout the year which is always exciting. The listing discusses the company’s culture and how much they value their team which for me is important. When looking for work, I believe that the company is a more crucial factor to use when deciding between two similar roles, especially over a slight monetary increase. It also discusses a competitive salary, on-going training/development and a professional yet friendly work environment. .</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need:</h3>
					<p>The position requires a few essential attributes including, a bachelor’s degree or diploma in Information Technology and alongside it around a year of experience in a similar role. The employer also asks the applicant to recognise their company systems including SCCM and InTune. On top of this they desire someone with above average verbal and written skills and is driven to solve problems. Besides what the employer is directly asking for almost any experience in an I.T environment would help in achieving this position, as it shows that you are passionate about the field. </p>
					<h3>Skills I Have:</h3>
					<p>Since only recently starting my studies in a Bachelor of Information Technology Course, I currently do not meet this requirement. I also have no experience in a workplace like this, so will hopefully be able to achieve this before or shortly after I have graduated. I believe my written and verbal communication skills are strong, and with a little bit more time will become more than adequate for a position such as this. I believe I am already more than passionate enough about the I.T industry which will hopefully help me to become successful. </p>
					<h4>Learning Plans:</h4>
					<p>Graduating from this course will set me up with nearly all the requirements for this position. Simply completing the course will already help me to find work in a similar workplace such as an I.T technician at a school or something more casual. Hopefully throughout my course I will become familiar or at least touch bases with software such as SCCM and InTune and if not, I can explore them in my personal time. Essentially my biggest roadblock in being offered a position such as this is trying my best throughout the degree and graduating. </p>

					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator:</h2>
					<p>The Myers Briggs Type Indicator test was developed by the mother-and-daughter team of Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs. It is a self-report inventory designed to identify a person's peronsality type, strengths, and preferences.</p>

					<h2>Test Two:</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
					<p>The second online test was based on the way people learn, more commonly known as an online learning style test. The results showed that I am a Visual/Tactile learner. As a visual learner, seeing and reading are more benefitial methods to storing information. Tactile however, discusses the indivual having a more hands on approach where touching and doing are more viable.   </p>
					<p><img src="PersonalityTest2small.jpg" alt="MBTI Results" /></p>

					<h2>Test Three:</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Workplace integrity</p>
					<p>The last online test discusses workplace integrity. Mainly focusing on honesty surrounding theft, days off and time wasted at work. The work ethics discussed throughout the test ranged from simple time theft when surfing the web for unnecessary reasons, to potentially stealing a large sum of money. Some employers may use this to get an indication of the decision making within your own actions and bringing light to those of your fellow employees.</p>

					<h3>What does this mean for me?</h3>
					<p> With or without having taken similar tests such as this before, the results solidify what I knew about myself. I was confident about my learning styles being majority tactile and visual and take advantage of this quite a lot. In addition, a lot of the results on the Myers-Briggs test are accurate to my personality traits. While I would not call myself an entrepreneur type this is how it is defined through personality tests alike. My results discuss things such as how ESTP-A love to be the center of attention, laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor. In terms of workplace habits, they love tackling problems as they arise and can adapt to many work situations. According to the test their most challenging position is first starting out, while they can be restrained and take orders well, they hate having others’ rules and regulations forced upon them. They will always take a more exciting task out of two choices and be able to work well with just about any colleague.</p>
					<h3>How does this influence team behaviour?</h3>
					<p>Regarding my behavior in a team the results indicate that while I can work well individually on certain tasks. However, I would far prefer to work within a team. Even though emotional sensitivity is not a strong suit, I am observant and well-tuned to the changes in my colleagues’ moods which in turn I could be boost and encourage them easily. A big strength of this personality type details how I would make a natural group leader, but do not actively seek the role. The weaknesses of the ESTP-A are quite important to behavior in a team environment. Being insensitive, impatient, and unstructured are some unfortunate attributes when working in a team in my opinion. </p>
					<h3>What does this mean when forming teams?  </h3>
					<p>These traits are positive when retroactively forming a team as I can easily let someone else lead the project, but at the same time take the role of the leader if needs be. My learning style also should be considered. If the project or teamwork requires having to understand or take in a lot of information, forming a team around people who share the same or similar learning styles may help to speed up and improve this process. I think having this personality has an advantage when forming a team as I am adaptable and can work with many other personality types. If someone is quiet, I can work well with them and hopefully they would consider my leadership and what I have to say. But, if they are loud, we can bounce off each other also working well. Some people may struggle to be as adaptable and not want to work with certain personalities.  </p>
